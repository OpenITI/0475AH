90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original text file contained both the main text, by al-
    Ṭusī,
    and a taʿlīq by Mīr Dāmād. PV split off the main text from the taʿlīq.
    Many pages contain only taʿlīq, not main text;
    the page numbers for these are omitted in this text file.
    PV tagged the section headers (usually introduced with "mā ruwiya fī", or simply
    "fī");
    only in one case (PageV02P779), a hierarchy was apparent - but there may be more
    cases.
    PV made sure all numbered paragraphs start at a new line.
    PV also typed up a number of missing sections: on PageV01P003, PageV02P674.
    The text consists of 6 ajzā'; it is not clear whether these belong to the
    manuscript
    tradition or are introduced by the editor/publisher. PV has tagged the
    statements about the end and beginning of the ajzā' as paratext;
    in two cases (juz' 3 and 4), the start of the juz' is in the middle of a
    section.
    The text contains an editorial introduction and endnotes, tagged as EDITOR by
    PV.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. All headers collated with the PDF
    and a few minor corrections made to separate them from the body text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
