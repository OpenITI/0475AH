90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text corresponds very closely to the printed edition, no
    obvious errors.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I removed the NOTEV00N001 tags, but kept the
    successive numbers in square brackets and then tagged all the numbers and
    checked them by Peter’s script. So, now all the entries are tagged and have two
    numbers (one successive and one for the category). Editorial removed. 2- A
    different edition of the text is accessible here: https://www.noor-
    book.com/%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AA-
