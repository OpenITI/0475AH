90#VERS#COMMENT##: Paragraph tags have not been preserved; I tagged
    numbered paragraphs with regex. The text of the risala is based on the
    edition of Rasail Ibn Hazm (ed. I. Abbas, 2nd ed. 1987, vol 3)
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Removed the tag for the title of the text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
