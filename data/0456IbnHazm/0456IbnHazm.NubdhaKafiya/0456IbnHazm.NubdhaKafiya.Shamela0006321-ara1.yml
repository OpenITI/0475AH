90#VERS#COMMENT##: The pagination does not follow at all. The text quality is
        acceptable, but pagination does not follow the edition.
        There are a few minor diversions from the pdf at hand (such as paranthesis are
        missing from the subheadings (Fasl), which
        makes me suspect that perhaps the digital text is based on a pirated version.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
