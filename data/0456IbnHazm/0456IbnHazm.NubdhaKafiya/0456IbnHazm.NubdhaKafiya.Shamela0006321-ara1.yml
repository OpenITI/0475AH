90#VERS#COMMENT##: The pagination does not follow at all. The text quality is
    acceptable, but pagination does not follow the edition.
    There are a few minor diversions from the pdf at hand (such as paranthesis are
    missing from the subheadings (Fasl), which
    makes me suspect that perhaps the digital text is based on a pirated version.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added.
