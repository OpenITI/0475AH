       NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I deleted the tags for second and third- level headers since they are all part of sentences and cannot be tagged as headers. I also changed the tag for the two appendixes to PARATEXT since their authors seems to be premodern, although I couldn’t find any information about them. If they have identity, it’s better to split off their parts under their own names.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
