90#VERS#COMMENT##: The version I used for collation is a reprint. 2- Each chapter consists of several “مسألة”. Most of these Masails have titles added in square brackets. Ideally, all of them should have separate titles. So, I marked the untitled Masails as paragraphs but with two asterisks (# **) so that they are distinguishable and their titles can be added later by a specialist who will read the text carefully.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
