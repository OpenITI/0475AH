90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original digital text file contained al-Antaki's History
    and an appendix
    which was written probably by more than one author (see the editorâ€™s
    introduction, page 14).
    PV split the texts.
    HRH used the first-level headers for dynasties;
    second-level headers for Caliphs and third-level headers for years;
    and fourth-level headers for the title of events.
