90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text file was badly converted;
        on most pages, paragraphs were jumbled,
        and titles often appeared on the wrong pages.
        The page numbers come from the Cairo edition,
        but it seems the Shamela text was converted from a digital source
        that presented the text of the Muwatta' separately from the commentary.
        PV manually corrected the first 130 pages,
        then wrote a script to correct the order of the paragraphs.
        The text contains multiple section levels; apart from the main
        subject levels, there are faṣl, mas'ala, farʿ, farq sections.
        Some main chapters also contain bāb sections.
        No attempt has been made to create a hierarchy of those lower levels;
        faṣl and bāb were usually given third-level heading tags (### |||),
        the others fourth-level heading tags (### ||||).
        The text also contains special sections marked with ṣād and shīn;
        these seem to be the original text of the muwaṭṭa' and commentary.
        These I have marked as ### ||| $ .
        They are always in the order ṣād - shīn. I used this order to check
        for mistakes in the new order created by the script: whenever a ṣād
        section was not followed by a shīn section, something was clearly wrong.
        Most often, this was caused by section titles that were in the wrong place.
        I finished this check for the entire book.
        A final manual check was done for all pages with section titles.
        It is likely that even after this very labour-intensive cleaning,
        this text will remain far from perfect, but the text is in a usable state.
        NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 53200, 74175,
        112337
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Regarding the immense amount of work PV has done on
        this text, I did not change anything. The printed version is an old print with a
        very bad quality, and the digital version was in a terrible situation before PV
        makes improvements. As he writes, now, “the text is in a usable state”, however
        it is still “far from perfect”. The only way to make it perfect is to read and
        collate it with the PDF. Regarding the 7-volume length of the text and its bad
        quality, this will take tens of hours and should be done by a specialist
        interested in Fiqh. The alternative solution is to find a digital version of a
        newer edition like Dār al-Kutub edition and to add it to the corpus to get rid
        of such a trouble. The PDF of Dār al-Kutub edition is accessible here:
