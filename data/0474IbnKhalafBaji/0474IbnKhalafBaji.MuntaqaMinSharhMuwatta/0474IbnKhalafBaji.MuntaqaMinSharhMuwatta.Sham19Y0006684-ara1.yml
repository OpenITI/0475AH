90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text file was badly converted;
    on most pages, paragraphs were jumbled,
    and titles often appeared on the wrong pages.
    The page numbers come from the Cairo edition,
    but it seems the Shamela text was converted from a digital source
    that presented the text of the Muwatta' separately from the commentary.
    PV manually corrected the first 130 pages,
    then wrote a script to correct the order of the paragraphs.
    The text contains multiple section levels; apart from the main
    subject levels, there are faṣl, mas'ala, farʿ, farq sections.
    Some main chapters also contain bāb sections.
    No attempt has been made to create a hierarchy of those lower levels;
    faṣl and bāb were usually given third-level heading tags (### |||),
    the others fourth-level heading tags (### ||||).
    The text also contains special sections marked with ṣād and shīn;
    these seem to be the original text of the muwaṭṭa' and commentary.
    These I have marked as ### ||| $ .
    They are always in the order ṣād - shīn. I used this order to check
    for mistakes in the new order created by the script: whenever a ṣād
    section was not followed by a shīn section, something was clearly wrong.
    Most often, this was caused by section titles that were in the wrong place.
    I finished this check for the entire book.
    A final manual check was done for all pages with section titles.
    It is likely that even after this very labour-intensive cleaning,
    this text will remain far from perfect, but the text is in a usable state.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 53200, 74175,
    112337
