90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Paragraphs do not align perfectly, but pagination is
    fine. Structural hierarchy of sections is not very clear in the edition,
    so I have introduced hierarchy as I saw fit, in some cases highlighting
    parts that were not highlighted in the edition. An expert of the text
    may want to change this, especially as the edition used seems to be
    rather haphazard in its organisation. There is one paragraph missing on
    p. 232 -- fa-amma iqta3 al-istighlal. Text quality in general appears to
    have some issues, some missing letters and typos.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): A few changes in the levelling of the headers
    made. The missing paragraph reported by the annotator typed. PARATEXT added.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
