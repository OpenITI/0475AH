90#VERS#COMMENT##: I removed the tags for Juz’ and tagged them as PARATEXT since
        most of them have no effect on the structure of the text. The categorization of
        the text is chronological. Although the names listed under some years are not
        necessarily relevant to that year (like the names of Sahabis listed under year
        11 AH), I think we have to keep this categorization since this is the
        categorization of the author. 2- Under each year, there is a section for
        obituaries and then a section for those who are born at that year. I added blank
        headers to separate these two parts.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
