90#VERS#COMMENT##: I removed the tags for Juz’ and tagged them as PARATEXT since most of them have no effect on the structure of the text. The categorization of the text is chronological. Although the names listed under some years are not necessarily relevant to that year (like the names of Sahabis listed under year 11 AH), I think we have to keep this categorization since this is the categorization of the author. 2- Under each year, there is a section for obituaries and then a section for those who are born at that year. I added blank headers to separate these two parts.
