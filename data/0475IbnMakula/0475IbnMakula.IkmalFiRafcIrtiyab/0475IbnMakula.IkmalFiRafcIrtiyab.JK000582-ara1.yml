90#VERS#COMMENT##: The digital version seems to be a reprint of the
        edition I used for collation. Page numbers are the same in all volumes
        except the seventh volume. 2- In vol 7, the first 38 pages of the PDF
        are missing. 3- “0” appears in some places in the text (mostly instead
        of dots) and @ appears before page numbers. 4- The text includes a lot
        of names, but these names are not part of the structure. So, I didn’t
        tag them (After asking the team about it). 5- The main idea of the text
        is to introduce the names that are very close to each other and might be
        mistaken (like “أثير” and “أبير”) in separate sections. So, after the
        main title, the text explains about each of the names in a few
        subsections. But there is no subtitle to differentiate these
        subsections. Under some of the main titles, there is a subtitle entitled
        “الكنى و الآباء” which explains about the names of the people whose sons
        hold the name which was being discussed in the previous subsection. I
        tagged these titles as sub-headers of the main titles–exactly following
        the format of the printed version. However, I must warn that the
        categorization of the printed version is incorrect. Because, as I said,
        the problem is that the subsections that explain about each of the names
        do not have any title. So, these subtitles are actually subtitles of
        major titles that do not exist (not the subtitles of the main titles. In
        the ideal format, the major header = the title including all names; the
        sub-header = one of the names in the title; sub-sub-header = “الكنى و
        الآباء”). The same thing is true about another subtitle “مختلف فيه”
        which explains about a different person who has the same name as the one
        that was being discussed in the previous subsection. This subtitle is
        again the subtitle of a previous major title that does not exist. A
        specialist in Rijal can add a lot of names as titles to separate the
        subsections that are about specific names, and put the above-mentioned
        two titles as sub-headers of these added titles, and thus present a
        correct categorization of the text (NOTE: In Vol 1, both of these titles
        appear in the middle of sentences, but in other volumes, they appear as
        separate titles).
