90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text matches closely the printed edition.
    Occasionally titles are either duplicated or missing in part. The
    pagination from pg. 100 is not consistent in terms of numbering (e.g.,
    reverts to V00P000). Lines 4613-4625 seem to be a scribal error. It
    appears to be a section which has the correct header, but then the wrong
    text. It should be removed. However, by line 4635 it is back in line
    with the printed edition.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
